# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
Car price prediction is an important application of machine learning in the automobile industry.  
The price of a car depends on several factors such as year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission, number of owners, and present price.

This project uses **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to predict the **selling price of a car** based on historical data.
